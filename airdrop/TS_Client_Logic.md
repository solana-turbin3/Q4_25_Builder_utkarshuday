# Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development?

1. Typescript is widely used by developers, so it's easier to learn a new technology like Solana. No steep learning curve.
2. Type-safety provided by Typescript was equally important, so vanilla Javascript was out of the equation.
3. Many client side interactions done by React.js, Next.js or any client-side framework require Typescript, so it was a perfect choice to interact with Solana programs
